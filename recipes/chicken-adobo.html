            <p class="definition">This is a very tasty and easy-to-make Filipino chicken dish made with soy sauce, garlic, and vinegar. 
                I can just as easily double or triple the chicken in this recipe to serve guests at a party. Serve over 
                rice with just a little of the sauce (not too much).</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
                <li>¾ cup vinegar</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons minced garlic</li>
                <li>3 bay leaves</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate.</li>
                <li>In a large pot, mix soy sauce, water, vinegar, honey, garlic, bay leaves, 
                    and pepper. Bring the mixture to a boil, and place the chicken into the pot. 
                    Reduce heat, cover, and cook 35 to 40 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Remove chicken, drain on paper towels, and set aside. Discard bay leaves. 
                    Return the mixture to a boil, and cook until reduced to about 1 1/2 cups.
                </li>
                <li>Place chicken on the prepared grill, about 5 minutes on each side, until 
                    browned and crisp. Serve with the remaining soy sauce mixture.
